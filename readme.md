Techmino: Unofficial Expansion

v0.1 just released! Things added: Master DEATH mode, classic/world skins.

Master DEATH: Master DEATH is T.A. Death mode that has been ported to Techmino and changed a bit. It starts with regular 20G with pretty big delays, and reaches its' maximum speed at lv500. Complete all 999 levels in a       certain time limit to get an X rank! (Good luck getting X rank in ARS_Z with flipped spawns :D)
    
Classic/World skins: Two new skins got added at the end of skin list: World and Classic.
