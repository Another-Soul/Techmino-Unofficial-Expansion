v0.1 Changelog (01.08.2023):

Master DEATH: Master DEATH is T.A. Death mode that has been ported to Techmino and changed a bit. It starts with regular 20G with pretty big delays, and reaches its' maximum speed at lv500. Complete all 999 levels in a certain time limit to get an X rank! (Good luck getting X rank in ARS_Z with flipped spawns :D)
    
Classic/World skins: Two new skins got added at the end of skin list: World and Classic.



v0.2 Changelog (07.08.2023):

Master PHANTOM: A mode where the locked blocks are completely invisible, combined with DEATH speeds! The torikans are slightly higher too, to compensate for invisibility.

Skin colors: Classic and World skins support all the colors from now on, including pentominoes and garbage blocks.

Dig Eff 10L MDT: A mode, which is similar to Dig Eff 10L, but with only monominoes, dominoes, and triminoes. Clear the mode with 9 pieces to get an X rank!
